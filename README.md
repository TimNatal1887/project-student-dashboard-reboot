### Description:

On the landing page, you will see a list of all the students in the program. Above that list, you will find how many students are listed. Each student has their full name, email, and birthday displayed. There is also an indicator for if the student is "On Track to Graduate" when they have their graduation requirements met. An option to sort the cohort season and year by ascending and descending order is also available.

To the left of the page, there is a list of each cohort sorted by the season and year. Each season and year shows each student that belongs within that cohort.

When you click each student, you will be taken to a different view. There you will find a table with details on their Codewars, scores, and certifications. Below that table is a form where you can add a comment and enter the name of the author of the comment and the comment. Once a comment is submitted, it will be added to a thread below the form.

Our page also has a "Dark Mode" feature available. By clicking the button on the top left of the page, you can toggle dark mode on and off.
